# YouTube-Downloader
a program to download MP4 and MP3 files from YouTube
##Important information
at the moment this only works on windows, I plan on attempting to make a mac and linux version soon. For MP3 dowloads you need to install FFMPEG and make it a path variable, the guide is down below.
## Getting Started
go to this site: [ffmpeg download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html) and download ffmpeg. Then open the terminal and type the following:
```
pip install PyQt5 yt-dlp
```
then you can open the executable and insert a link from youtube, put in your directory of choice and click MP3 for audio and MP4 for video
for more instructions on how to get ffmpeg go to:
